<main style="font-size: 1.3em;width: min(800px,90%);margin-inline:auto;text-align: justify;">
    <p>Hi! I like birds. And that's my personality trait.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2021, I was gifted a bridge camera â€”a Canon PowerShotâ€” and started taking pictures with it.
    I've used it for wildlife photography since the beginning, though I didn't start to take an interest in birds until several months later.
    At fist, my main subjects were damselflies (I have a ton of photos of those from back then), but, as time went on,
    I began to shoot more birds and learn more about them. And here we are now.</p>
    <p>I also find web design rather appealing (how unexpected!). My first steps at it actually stem from an unusual place: spreadsheets.
    Several years ago now, I started working along other people on a spreadsheet that serves as a guide with a ton of resources for a videogame.
    After much work gathering more and more information not found anywhere else (such as the damage formula), I started learning JavaScript
    to write scripts that would let me improve the sheet.
    I also started making a website to be able to have all that information in a more accessible way, but soon after I started this site and... yeah.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Regarding this site, It began as a learning project in the summer of 2023.
    At first, I was convinced I'd be able to have it ready by September. Naturally, that was not the case.
    Though it is true that it could have been ready a lot sooner <span style="text-decoration: line-through">had I dedicated any time to it throughout 2024</span>.</p>
    <p>The site and (almost) all resources in it were made by myself from scratch. Coming from someone who knew little to nothing,
    in the beginning, many things were... questionable. For instance, for the carousel animations, I had a whopping 200 lines of JavaScript to calculate the exact positions of each element on screen.
    As inline styles applied to each element. Because who needs CSS. Or readable code. Nonetheless, this is still a project to learn from mistakes like that and I <i>think</i> I've taken a thing or two away from it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Right now I'm studying a double bachelor's degree in Math and Informatics. I spent a lot of time wanting to do Math and Physics (ðŸ’€),
    but, in part due to the horrible year I'd had with Physics, in part because I'd already started using JavaScript and I wanted to learn programming in a proper way,
    I changed my mind. There's a whopping one (1) subject about web design, but at least that's better than none.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly enough, there are other things I enjoy in life. For instance, I've been doing varsity debate
        for several years now â€”in fact, in the gallery, there are several photos I took on a trip to Cape Verde as a prize for winning a competition.
    Besides, I also like a very niche 3DS game (the spreadsheet one) probably way too much.
        Back in high school, I did a project about the hidden math of the game and finding out the damage formula.
    I'm also really fortunate to be a part of the team making the biggest mod in existence for the game. Mi contribution is being a huge nerd!</p>
